# PacificRetail Data Warehouse Modernization

## 🎯 Project Overview
A comprehensive data warehouse migration project for PacificRetail, an international e-commerce company, transitioning from legacy on-premise infrastructure to a modern cloud-based Snowflake solution. This project demonstrates enterprise-scale data engineering practices using the Medallion Architecture pattern.

*Note: This is a learning project based on LinkedIn Learning course by Deepak Goyal, implemented for educational and portfolio purposes.*

## 🔴 Business Context

### Company Profile
**PacificRetail** is a rapidly growing e-commerce platform operating across multiple countries, experiencing significant expansion in both customer base and product catalog.

### Current Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|---------|
| **Data Silos** | Customer data, product information, and transaction records isolated in separate systems, preventing unified business insights |
| **Processing Delays** | 24-hour lag in batch processing prevents real-time decision-making and responsive business operations |
| **Scalability Constraints** | On-premise infrastructure cannot auto-scale to meet growing data volumes and processing demands |
| **Data Quality Issues** | Inconsistent data standards across international branches compromise analytics accuracy |
| **ML Readiness** | No infrastructure for advanced analytics and machine learning initiatives |

## 💡 Solution Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake (multi-cloud, auto-scaling)
- **Cloud Storage**: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **Processing**: Near real-time data pipelines with incremental processing

### Data Sources
📊 Customer Data (CSV)
└── Daily exports from CRM system

📦 Product Catalog (JSON)
└── Hourly updates from inventory management

💳 Transaction Logs (Parquet)
└── Real-time streaming from e-commerce platform

- Incremental update handling
- Data quality enforcement

#### **Gold Layer** 🥇
- Business-level aggregates
- Optimized data marts for specific use cases
- Analytics-ready datasets
- ML feature stores

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Features

1. **External Stage Integration**
   - ADLS connection via Snowflake external stages
   - Efficient data loading using COPY command

2. **Automation & Orchestration**
   - Snowflake Tasks for workflow automation
   - Scheduled and event-driven processing

3. **Change Data Capture**
   - Streams for incremental data processing
   - Reduced processing overhead and costs

4. **Data Recovery & Versioning**
   - Time Travel for historical analysis
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities

5. **Environment Management**
   - Zero-copy cloning for dev/test/prod environments
   - Cost-effective environment provisioning

## 📋 Implementation Workflow
Data Ingestion
